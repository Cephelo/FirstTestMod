## A Music Box
A Music Box allows player to craft music discs using Murichorum, a new ore found under Chorus plants.

On top of a few other things, adds two new data-driven crafting methods.  More info can be seen on [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/a-music-box) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/a-music-box).

JEI/REI is highly recommended for recipe discovery.  Trimmed is an optional dependency if you want proper trim materials for Murichorum and Echothyst.

If you have suggestions for config options or new recipes, please leave them in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/R7FMTfu).  I've also set up a [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/a-music-box-mcmod) for submitting localizations!

Note on ports: It's unlikely I'll be porting to other versions or loaders, but maybe if I'm asked enough.  Not 1.12 though.

Custom sounds are sourced from ZapSplat.  Special thanks to Kaupenjoe for his 1.21.1 Neoforge modding tutorials, and those in the Neoforge and MMD discord servers for their guidance.
